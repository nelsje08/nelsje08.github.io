    <ul>
     <li>Camping is what I love to do with my family. We loved taking the pop-up out for a national park roadtrip when I was a kid.</li>
     <li>I also worked as a camp counselor for a year at the camp that made me fall in love with the outdoors as a kid. Many memories have been made around bonfires with great friends!</li>
   </ul>
   <p><i>Traveling</i></p>
   <img width=500 src="https://scontent-ord1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/11138531_10205287209876438_699656467859622276_n.jpg?oh=7e64aee0b349e78fba39e10b984db554&oe=569EFE7E">
    <ul>
     <li>I have been so lucky to have an awesome family that encoraged traveling right from the start! I can now say I've officially caught the traveling bug after spending an amazing semseter in Europe during the spring of 2015!</li>
