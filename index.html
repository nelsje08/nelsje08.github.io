<p>Hi All! I am currently a senior at Luther College in Decorah, IA. I will be graduating in May 2016 with a Degree in English and two minors in Business Management and International Studies. I would describe myself as quirky, organized, and hardworking. I am currently looking for future careers in Marketing, Journalism, PR, and Publishing. Shoot me an email so I can learn a bit about you!</p>
